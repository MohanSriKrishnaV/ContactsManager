# ContactsManager Project

Deployment link : https://glittering-druid-60a08c.netlify.app/

Welcome to my Contacts Manager Full Stack project! This is a web application that allows you to manage your contacts easily and efficiently.

The project is built using a full stack approach, which means that it includes both front-end and back-end components. On the front-end, I used React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for efficient and responsive UI rendering, making it a great choice for building modern web applications.
On the back-end, I used Node.js and Express to build a RESTful API. The API communicates with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve contact information. Using a RESTful architecture allows for a clean and organized API design that is easy to understand and use.

The application includes a range of features such as adding, editing, and deleting contacts, searching for contacts by name, and filtering contacts by category. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and manage your contacts.
In addition to the core functionality, the application also includes user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and access their own contacts without interference from others.

Overall, the Contacts Manager Full Stack project is a robust and efficient solution for managing your contacts. Whether you're a business owner, freelancer, or just someone looking to keep their contacts organized, this application has everything you need to get started.
